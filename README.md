Orchestra
=========

Orchestra is a platform for real-time decision making in any network with sensors. We provide a ridiculously simple interface for users to specify their sensor data pipelines from the raw sensors all the way to the actuators. 

At any point in time, data from two sensors has more information when compared a single sensor. Thanks to Moore's law and the corresponding improvements in software, we will be assisted by thousands of ubiquitous sensors and actuators. They will become as natural as electricity. In such a scenario, it is critical to have a platform that can coordinate and make sense of the heterogeneous data generated by the numerous sensors. We believe our product Orchestra will be of use to anyone who has a requirement to weave in multiple sources of data to generate more valuable data which would be helpful to others in the ecosystem. We are specifically interested in the IoT applicability of this platform.

We worked hard on the design of the platform to make it extremely simple to orchestrate data from multiple data sources and provide real-time decisions. Since the platform essentially coordinates a groups of seemingly independent IoT sensors to be a part of a coherent and consistent knowledge, we call this as the Orchestra.
